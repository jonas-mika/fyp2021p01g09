Group 9: Aidan Stocks, Christian Margo Hansen, Jonas-Mika Senghaas, Malthe RÃ¸dsgaard Pabst Lauridsen, Rasmus Bondo Hansen

### Project Description
In this project, we have completed tasks similar to data scientists working for a department of transport or a city government, to inform city leaders about traffic fatalities and injuries, and give insights for urban transport planning. We have explored and analysedthe latest data records of all recorded road collisions in Great Britain in the year 2019 provided by the UK Department of Transport with detailsabout the circumstances of personal injury. The major parts of the project are:
- Exploring and transforming the data, making numericaland visual reports
- Connecting data tables (accidents, vehicles, casualties)
- Investigating possible statistical associations by filtering for a variety of attributes
- Visualizing the data on a map
- Involving self-obtained external data sets in the analysis

### TODOs
- [ ] Clone Repo on everyone's local machine and introduce to collaborating on git
- [ ] Make Plan on how to move on
- [x] Fix Bug of Missing Values 
- [ ] Add Docstrings to all Functions
- [ ] Comment out Code
- [ ] Visualise Dates and Times (One Plot for Monthly Distribution, One Plot for )
- [x] Make Numerical Histogram Report (and numerical report to compute key metrics) for numerical values (such as age distribution)
- [ ] Implement Text Wrapping for nicer looking plots
- [ ] Maybe have a look at spatial data science (visualisation of geographic data)
